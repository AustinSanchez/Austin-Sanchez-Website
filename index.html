        <p class="lead mb-4">Currently, I am eighteen years old and studying Business with a concentration in Finance at the University of California Riverside. After I receive my bachelors degree in June of 2023, I plan to further my education and get a masters degree in finance. I do not have a preference of what school I attend, as long as the school has a well rounded reputation. I have completed my first quarter here at UCR and achieved a cumulative GPA of 3.3. My classes were very hard as I was trying to get the hard breadth courses out of the way. The three classes I took were: Business 10, Biological Anthropology, and History of Western Art Prehistoric to Byzantine. Due to the fact that I lack interest in history, art, and science, I struggled in these classes. Biological Anthropology focused in depth about evolution and how humans have transformed over time. This information was very new to me and hard to comprehend. I ended up finishing this class with an overall grade of a B+. In my History of Western Art Prehistoric to Byzantine class, the professor went in depth about art during different time ages. The midterms and quizzes were very complex and were hard to study for. I ended up finishing this class with an overall grade of a B+. Both of these classes were not part of my major and I only took them to fulfill my breadth requirements. In my business 10 class, I understood all of the information fairly well. However, I received a B+ in the class because I fell asleep in almost every lecture due to the fact that I had the luxury to sit in reclining movie theatre seats. At nine oâ€™clock in the morning, itâ€™s very hard to stay awake for an hour and a half. At the end of my first quarter, I received a total of three B+â€™s.  

<br><br>

        Benefiting my school and community has always been an important aspect of my life. I have always enjoyed helping others and making the lives around me better. In the past couple of years, I wanted to do more in my community so I began looking for places to volunteer at. Due to the fact that I was good with math and loved helping children, I found a volunteer center by the name of Middle Tree Tutoring Center. After interviewing with the manager, I exceeded the requirements to be a volunteer to help children over the summer of 2016. After volunteering 25 hours over the summer, school began and I wanted to volunteer somewhere closer to home. At school, I took advantage of the opportunity to join the National Beta Club and AP Environmental Science Club. In the AP Environmental Science Club, we worked together collaboratively to look into different methods of how we can improve our local communityâ€™s environment. We also worked on project plans with the school and city in order to better the quality of life around our local environment and eventually become a model for what other communities and cities should look at in the future. The National Beta Club is a nonprofit organization that allows students to volunteer in the community and help others. Within this organization, I attended many volunteer events such as; park clean-ups, hiking trail clean-ups, helping set up/clean up a Walk for Alzheimer's event, helping run carnival games for kids at a Harvest night festival at West Heritage Elementary school, and assisting in food drives/fundraisers for multiple charity organizations. While helping the people around me, I feel a sense of pride and warm-heartedness in knowing that I can make a difference in the world around me and even if itâ€™s not a big impact, at least itâ€™s the beginning of a larger cause.
